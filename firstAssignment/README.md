This is a README file for the first assignment of the PACS' course 
In order to run the code, in the Makefile, since we are linking against muParser's library,
you should change the variables LDFLAGS and LDLIBS adding your local path for muparser.so.2
After executing the code you can plot the numerical solution vs analytic solutioin running plot.sh(eventually with chmod u+x)
