# Build a hierarchy of solvers for $f(x) = 0$

The code is organized as follows:  

- `include`: contains the custom header files `.hpp` used by the program;  

- `src`: contains all the source code files `.cpp` used by the program, the `Makefile` and the input file `solver_params.dat`, this is also the folder in witch the object files `.o` and the executable `main` generated by compiling, will be stored;

## Before running the code

Edit the `Makefile` and change the `PACS-ROOT` variable to the local path tho the [`pacs-examples`][1] directory  

## To run the code

The `Makefile` will provide the following functionalities:  

- `make`: compiles the code and produces the executable `main`;  

- `make run`: compiles and runs the code;

- `make clean`: deletes all `.o` files;  

## The code

The `Solver_class` class implements the following solver methods:  

- quasi newton  
- secant  
- bisection  

The `SolverFactory` class is the callable class used for constucting pointers to `Solver_class` objects.  
  
The `SolverParamaters` is used by `SolverFactory()` for reading the parameters.  
  
Feel free to change the functon and the parameters in the `solver_params.dat` file
